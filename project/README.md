# Overview of Project

In this paper, we define and study a new rating analysis algorithm called Weighted Conjunction Analysis (WCA) for supervised sentiment analysis, which aims to tackle opinion shift in presence of conjunction words/phrases in multinomial sentiment classification tasks. We divide all conjunction words in four categories and build a WCA model that learns the weights of each side of each conjunction type using labeled reviews with only one conjunction. To make predictions on unlabeled reviews, we parse each review in presence of conjunctions (one or more) using a novel tree-based data structure called Logic Tree (LT) based on predefined conjunction priority and apply learned weights onto each logic tree to predict ratings. Empirical experiment on a Amazon fine food review dataset shows that WCA can successfully improve the performance of existing multinomial rating classification algorithms that do not involve conjunction handling. The results and weights mined by WCA for each conjunction type can also be used in a wide range of applications such as comparing reviewersâ€™ rating behaviors, improving ranking algorithms and refining recommender systems based on more accurate ratings.
